# What the heck is The Gain Blaster 

This tool provides a **magnetic declination corrected bearing** from your QTH to your target QSO to assist with field placement and orientation of your antenna. 

It is meant to be used on your phone in the field. It can run on a desktop but it's not as cool. 

## How to install: 

**open the link in Chrome on your phone. Click the 3 dots > add to home screen > install**
It requires internet for all the fancy maps. But you can still calculate bearings via grid squares and Lat/Lon offline.

## How to use:

Set your QTH location on the azimuth map. You can manually enter your latitude and longitude or just tap Set QTH Location (requires phone's location services)

Tap the satellite icon to toggle between the QTH fine tuning satellite view map.
(You can drag your QTH pin in this view or tap and hold to drop a new pin.)

Then scroll down to the target location input. Here you can select the QSO target by Lat / Lon, grid square, entering a city and country or selecting on map. 
If you want to select on map tap Set Target with Map button (bottom) - Tap and hold to set the target.

Once the target is set you will see the True Azimuth bearing, the Corrected Magnetic Bearing, the Magnetic Declination for your QTH and distance from QTH to Target. 

Tap the magnifying glass icon to change range view of the azimuth map.

## Optional feature: Radiation Pattern Sim 

Select from a preset antenna type or select custom from the dropdown menu and enter your own variables. Be careful with this tool. The cheese on the pizza is still hot.
